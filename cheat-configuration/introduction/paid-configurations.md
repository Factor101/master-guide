# Paid Configs

You may see lots of popular youtubers dominating in every hvh match, while you struggle to kill even a single player. Then these youtubers told you to join their membership to get access to their configs. You may join their membership, download their config, then try it out. Then, bullets hit you simultaneous to the realization that it made no difference.

## Configs aren't everything 
A good config can help you to get more kills, but the most important thing is your playstyle. You need both to to dominate a match. The reality: you may not even be using the same config as the youtubers are using themselves, which means they might be selling a fake config. Even if that is not true, there is no guarantee that their config will match your playstyle which is essential for your success. 

## Leaked Configs
It's inevitable that youtubers configs get leaked and if you know where to look you can find almost any youtubers config you want. See our section on leaking websites for where you might be able to find these.
